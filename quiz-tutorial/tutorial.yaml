# This file shows how to write various types of quiz questions.
# Consult README.md for more information.

# Each file contains one question normally -- however, here we put the
# questions into a single array, so in this file there is an extra level of
# indentation and a hyphen at the beginning of each question that wouldn't
# normally be in a question file
